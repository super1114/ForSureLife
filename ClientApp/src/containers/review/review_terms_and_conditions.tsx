                                Confidentiality for New York Victims of Domestic Violence/Endangered Individuals
                                The provisions in New York Insurance Law, section 2612 sets forth confidentiality protocols for domestic violence victims and endangered individuals and prohibits insurers from discriminating against victims of domestic violence.
                                According to this law, if any person covered by an insurance policy delivers to the insurer that issued the policy a valid order of protection against a policyholder or other person covered by the policy, the insurer is prohibited for the duration of the order from disclosing to the policyholder or the other person covered, the address and telephone number of the insured, or of any person or entity providing the covered services to the insured. If the covered person is a child, then this right may be asserted by the child's parent or legal guardian.
                                The law also provides that no insurer may: refuse to issue or renew, deny or cancel any insurance policy; demand or require a greater premium or payment from any person or designate domestic violence as a prior condition, for which coverage will be denied/reduced. The fact that a person is or has been a victim of domestic violence is not permitted in underwriting criterion.
                                The law also requires a health insurer, as defined in that section of the law to include an accident and health insurer, to accommodate reasonable requests by a person covered by an insurance policy to receive communications of claim- related information by alternative means or at alternative locations if the person clearly states that disclosure of the information could endanger him or her. If the covered person is a child, then the child's parent or legal guardian may make the request. The insurer, without the express written consent of the person making the request, is prohibited from disclosing to the policyholder (1) the address, telephone number, any other personally identifying information of the person making the request or child for whose benefit a request was made (2) the nature of the health care services provided; or (3) the name or address of the provider of the covered services.
                                The request must include an alternative address, telephone number and/or other reasonable methods of contact. The request should be made by emailing a copy of the order of protection to the insurer at info@americanseniordirect.com. In order to revoke a request that has been received and implemented, the requesting person must submit to the insurer a written sworn statement revoking the prior request.
